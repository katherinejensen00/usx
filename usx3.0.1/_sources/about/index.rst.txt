What is Unified Scripture XML?
------------------------------

USX is an XML format used for encoding the digital text for scripture translations. USX follows the `standard syntax <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/>`_ for XML documents. The :doc:`structure </structure>`, :doc:`elements </elements>`, and :doc:`attributes </attributes>` are derived significantly from the close association USX has with `USFM <https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm>`_ (Unified Standard Format Markers), an older alternative markup scheme for scripture still in widespread use. The largest collection of USX encoded scripture is currently found within the `Digital Bible Library <http://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org>`_.
