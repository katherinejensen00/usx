.. note:: **Numbered <ms> @style Attributes**

    As with USX :ref:`<para> <usx-element_para>` elements which include a numeric variable in the @style attribute, a number may be added to a milestone @style attribute to indicate a relative weighting or level.
    
    **style = style1** — The unnumbered version of a style attribute may be used when only one level of this milestone style exists within the project text. Numbers should always be included when more than one level of the milestone style exists within the project text.
